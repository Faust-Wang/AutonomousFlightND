## **Udacity: Autonomous Flight Nanodegree**

### **Projects:**

- [x] [**P1:** Backyard Flyer](https://github.com/danielkelshaw/AutonomousFlightND/tree/master/p1-backyard-flyer)
    <br>
    This project was predominantly concerned with providing an introduction 
    to event driven programming and using the simulation tools provided by
    Udacity. The main task involved commanding the drone to follow a path
    by issuing a number of instructions that could be followed in real-time.
    <br>
    <br>
- [x] [**P2:** Motion Planning](https://github.com/danielkelshaw/AutonomousFlightND/tree/master/p2-motion-planning)
    <br>
    The 'Motion Planning' project was concerned with developing a path
    planning algorithm that provided a drone with a series of waypoints to
    follow in order to move from A to B. The final solution is based on the
    A* planning algorithm and uses a colinearity check to cull the number of
    waypoints produced. Graph-based methods have also been explored but are
    not implemented within the project.

    <br>
- [x] [**P3:** Controls](https://github.com/danielkelshaw/AutonomousFlightND/tree/master/p3-controls)
    <br>
    The 'Controls' project revolved around designing and implementing a
    cascaded non-linear controller for a quadcopter - this involved
    designing a number of PI / PD / PID controllers to control various
    aspects of the drone's flight. Code was developed in C++ and the
    corresponding drone flight was tested in a simulation environment, this
    allowed for the controllers to be tuned appropriately.
    <br>
    <br>
- [x] [**P4:** Estimation](https://github.com/danielkelshaw/AutonomousFlightND/tree/master/p4-estimation)
    <br>
    This project involved developing an Extended Kalman Filter to process
    sensor data and provide meaningful state estimation of a quadcopter in
    a simulated environment. Various measurement / update models were
    developed in order to allow for improved state estimation.
